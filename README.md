# SchoolProjects

A collection of some of my more interesting university assignments:

Decryption (Java):
An exercise in cryptography: cracking a substitution cypher, vigenere cypher and RSA with simple keys.

KMeans (Java w/ Swing):
An implementation of the K-means algorithm to classify the Iris data set.

NeuralNet (C):
An implementation of a feed forward neural network trained with back propogation to classify handwritten digits.

PacketTransfer (Java w/ Swing):
A simulation of data transfer over an unreliable connection with a little bit of fun thrown in.

SelfOrganizingMap1 (C w/ SDL2):
An implementation of a Kohonen Self Organizing Map to find a solution for the Traveling Salesman Problem on random data.

SelfOrganizingMap2 (C w/ SDL2):
Another Kohonen Map implementation to classify a n-dimensional dataset.

TravelingSalesman (Java w/ Swing):
A graphical implementation of various algorithms to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem on the Berlin52 dataset.
