Output:

The grid represents the lattice, with each vector lying on the line
intersections. The colour of the background is the node classification. This is
what determines the classification of a data vector. Data vectors are
represented as small squares. Black outlines indicate training data, and white
testing data. Flashing squares indicate misclassifications. Blue represents a 
good motor, and red a bad motor.

The four bars represent the following from top to bottom:
Current epoch as a ratio of the max epoch.
Data matched to lattice nodes as a ratio of the total data.
Current radius as a ratio of the initial radius.
Current learning rate as a ratio of the initial learing rate.
